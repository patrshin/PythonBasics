If you really want to redirect stdout to your file for some reason,
 it's not hard to do it better than fileinput does (basically, use try..finally or a contextmanager
 to ensure you set stdout back to it's original value afterwards). The source code for fileinput is
  pretty eye-bleedingly awful, and it does some really unsafe things under the hood.
 If it were written today I very much doubt it would have made it into the stdlib
